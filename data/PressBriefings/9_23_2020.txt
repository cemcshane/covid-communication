President Donald Trump:  
Hello. Thank you very much. Thank you. Today, Johnson & Johnson announced that their vaccine candidate has reached the final stage of clinical trials. This is record time. This is the fourth vaccine candidate in the United States to reach the final stage of trial. So we have four candidates already at a very late date, late being a very positive word in this case. Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson anticipated that they would reach phase one trials by September, but due to our support under Operation Warp Speed and to some of the incredible scientists involved, they’ve reached phase three trials by September, far ahead of schedule.

President Donald Trump:  
We encourage Americans to enroll in the vaccine trial. It’s not only interesting, it’ll be a terrific thing for our country. We encourage everybody to enroll, as many people as we can. Today, my administration announced that we are awarding $200 million of CARES Act funding to all 50 states to prepare to distribute the vaccine to high-risk residents. And we want to do that the instant it is approved, not the following day, but the following moment. So we’re going to be doing that, and we’ll be getting it ready because we have some great vaccines going to be coming out through Operation Warp Speed. We also continue to accelerate life-saving therapies.

President Donald Trump:  
We’re seeing promising results that are monoclonal antibody treatments, which help the immune system fight the virus and help very significantly, we’re finding, can reduce hospitalizations now by more than 70%. By cutting red tape and unleashing America’s medical genius, we’ve reduced the fatality rate 85% since April. For individuals under 50, they have a 99.98% rate of survival from the China virus. That’s a number that’s been really increasing substantially with time. As children go back to school, we’re encouraged that early research shows only a small degree of spread. Brown University conducted a study of more than 550 schools across 46 states and found that only 0.076% of students had confirmed cases of the virus. That’s a tiny percentage. And only 0.15% of teachers had confirmed cases.

President Donald Trump:  
Patients coming to the emergency room due to the virus is down to only 1.6% of all emergency room visits, the lowest since the pandemic began. 1.6% emergency room visits. As far as protecting the vulnerable is concerned, we provided over $21 billion to our nursing homes, and we are really focused on the nursing homes, everybody and including our governors. Governors are working very closely with the task force and with the vice-president and everybody involved. We’ve sent rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes in the country. This week, we’re sending hundreds of thousands of additional rapid tests to nursing homes to ensure that they can test staff regularly. And the staff now is being tested on a regular basis, but very strongly at the finest level, the highest level and the best tests. We’re encouraged at the number of Americans getting the flu vaccine is increasing by roughly 50% compared to last year, substantially up. The flu, when it’s mixed with COVID or China virus, is going to be very interesting to see what happens, but that can drive numbers. And we just don’t know what that will be yet, but you’ll have flu numbers and you’ll have some COVID numbers. I think we’re rounding the turn very much. You see what’s happening in Europe. However, they have a very big spike. Countries that we thought were doing well aren’t doing well. They had some very big spikes. A very big surge.

President Donald Trump:  
Months ago, we increased our nation’s procurement of the flu vaccine by 66% and we ask Americans to go get their annual flu shot as early as possible. It’s possible, I would imagine, Scott, that the flu can get mixed up with the virus and people can think it’s the virus when actually it’s another flu season coming on. I don’t know, I hope they can keep them separate. Can they keep them separate?

Scott:  
We hope so.

President Donald Trump:  
I doubt they will. It’s going to be a very interesting time, but we have a flu season coming up. We’ve had some flu seasons which are really massive over the years, over many years and we have some that are much less so, but it’s still significant. So I hope they can separate them because it’s pretty close.
